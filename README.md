 QuizNow-A platform for conducting quizzes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Quiz Management System initiative will be created to address the inefficiency of the manual system. In addition, the current method wastes time by requiring examiners to review answer sheets after exams; however, our application will verify the correct response, saving time and ensuring examination success. Users of this system do not need to have advanced computer knowledge, and the system will notify them when they input incorrect data.
This project's objective is to manage data regarding students, exams, grades, and classrooms. The exam will be assigned solely at the discretion of the teacher, who will ensure that it is accessible to all students.
